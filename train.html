            <h1>Train Travel: CFR vs. Private Operators</h1>
            <p><em>August 27, 2025</em></p>
            <p>Romania’s railways still matter for millions of travelers, but the experience can vary wildly depending on who runs the train. While CFR Călători used to be the only option, private companies have started changing the game in recent years. For those who ride the rails often, the differences between CFR and private operators are hard to miss—sometimes pleasant, sometimes frustrating.</p>

            <h2>CFR is shitty</h2>
            <p>When you board a CFR train, you never quite know what to expect. On major routes like Bucharest–Cluj or Bucharest–Constanța, some carriages have been updated with decent seating, air conditioning, and power outlets. But on secondary lines, you might feel like you’ve stepped back in time: old, rattling cars, windows that won’t close properly, questionable bathrooms, and delays that are more the rule than the exception. Tickets are cheap, which is why many still choose CFR, especially for long distances or routes with no alternatives. The catch? Even if you pay extra for an InterCity train, arriving on time isn’t guaranteed. Delays of an hour or more are almost a tradition, and passenger communication is often nonexistent—rarely will anyone explain why you’re stuck or when things might get back to normal.</p>

            <h2>But...hear me out....</h2>
           
            <p>Private operators like SoftTrans and Astra Trans Carpatic, on the other hand, have raised the bar. Their trains are clean, the staff is friendlier, and schedules are far more reliable. If you take Regio from Bucharest to Brașov, for example, you’re far more likely to arrive on time, and the journey is smoother. Buying tickets online is hassle-free, and onboard conditions are decent: working air conditioning, comfortable seats, and sometimes even Wi-Fi. Fares are a bit higher, but many travelers say it’s worth it. The downside? Private companies only serve the most profitable routes—think Cluj–Oradea or Timișoara–Arad—leaving much of the country without alternatives.</p>

          
            <p>The reality is clear, BUT......CFR wins on coverage and affordability but struggles with outdated infrastructure and inefficiency. Private operators deliver a better experience but aren’t an option everywhere. For frequent travelers, the choice comes down to budget and destination. If you’re a student or retiree looking to cross the country without spending much, CFR is still the way to go. But if you’re heading to Brașov, Cluj, or Timișoara and want a stress-free trip, a private train is the better bet.</p>
            <p>The government promises upgrades (for the last 30 years), with EU funding and bla bla, but for now, passengers are left choosing between cheap and comfortable. Some argue the entire network should be privatized; others believe CFR could improve with better management. </p>
