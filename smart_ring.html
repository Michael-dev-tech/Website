            <h1>Smart Rings Are a Terrible Idea</h1>
            <p><em>October 11, 2025</em></p>
            <p>Some YouTuber nearly lost his finger because his Samsung Galaxy Ring swelled up so bad he couldn't get it off. He was stuck at an airport for 48 hours, tweeting pictures of his bloated finger while flight attendants tried to yank it off with soap and water. Spoiler: that made it worse. He ended up in the ER where they had to ice his hand and use medical-grade lube just to slide the thing off. His ring wasn't even charged when it happened.</p>

            <p>Here's the thing: we already know lithium batteries swell. It happens in laptops, phones, everything. But somehow we thought it was a good idea to strap one to our finger—the one body part that swells when something squeezes it. And it's not just this guy. Reddit's full of people complaining about the same issue. Samsung's offering free replacements like that fixes the problem, but the real problem is the entire concept. <span class="bold-text">Why are we putting exploding batteries on our fingers?</span></p>

            <p>Samsung called it "extremely rare" and gave him a free hotel and a car ride home. Cool. But I'm done pretending wearable tech is worth the risk. Watches, fine. Rings? Absolutely not. I'll track my sleep the old-fashioned way—by waking up exhausted and hating my life.</p>
