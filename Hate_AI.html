            <h1>Why I Have AI (Even Though I Know It’s Garbage)</h1>
            <p><em>August 29, 2025</em></p>
            <p>Look, I get it. AI is a scam. It’s a lazy, soulless shortcut that turns real thought into regurgitated slop. It steals from artists, exploits workers, and makes everything—writing, art, even conversation—just a little bit worse. The people pushing it don’t care about progress; they care about profit. They want us to stop thinking, stop creating, and just consume their algorithmic mush.</p>

            <p>So why do I still use it sometimes? Because I’m tired.</p>

            <p>I’m tired of fighting a system that’s already decided efficiency matters more than quality. I’m tired of watching bosses replace real work with AI-generated nonsense while pretending it’s innovation. I’m tired of feeling like the only one who notices how empty it all is.</p>

            <p>I use AI because, in this mess of a world, it’s the path of least resistance. Not because I believe in it, but because I don’t have the energy to swim against the current every single day. I use it for the busywork—the emails, the summaries, the things that don’t matter—so I can save my brain for the things that do. I use it like a bad tool, not because I trust it, but because I’ve been forced to accept that this is how things are now.</p>

            <p>But I hate it. I hate that I rely on it. I hate that it’s turning us into passive consumers instead of active thinkers. I hate that it’s making us dumber, lazier, and more isolated. Most of all, I hate that we’ve let it get this far.</p>

            <p>So yeah, I have AI. But I refuse to love it. I refuse to pretend it’s anything more than what it is: a cheap imitation of human thought, built by vultures for people too exhausted to care. And one day, when the backlash finally comes, I’ll be ready to burn it all down. Until then, I’ll use it—<span class="bold-text">but I won’t forget what it’s costing us.</span></p>
