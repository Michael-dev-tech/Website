        <h1>Salt Bank’s New Investment Feature: Another Fintech Wrapper for Your Wallet</h1>
        <p><em>December 8, 2025</em></p>

        <p>Salt Bank, the "first Romanian neobank" (which is really just Banca Transilvania in a hoodie), has officially launched its investment platform. They want you to buy fractional shares and ETFs directly from their app. It looks sleek, it’s instant, and it’s powered by a German fintech called <strong>Upvest</strong>.</p>

        <p>And that’s exactly the problem.</p>

        <p>This isn't a brokerage account. It's an API wrapper. When you buy "Apple" stock through Salt, you aren't dealing with the market directly. You are sending a request to Salt, who sends a request to Upvest, who holds the securities in an omnibus account (a big bucket) in Germany. You don't own the share in your name; you own a claim against a claim.</p>
        
        <p>They call it "democratizing investments." I call it <span class="bold-text">gamification</span>. By reducing investing to a few taps next to your grocery transactions, they encourage impulse buying rather than long-term holding. Plus, adding layers of middlemen always introduces new points of failure. If Upvest goes down, or Salt's API integration breaks, good luck accessing your portfolio.</p>

        <p>If you want to invest, open a real brokerage account (like IBKR or even XTB). Stop letting banks treat your life savings like a microtransaction in a mobile game. Convenience is the enemy of ownership.</p>
