        <h1>Microsoft: "30% of Our Code is AI." Also Microsoft: "Windows is Broken."</h1>
        <p><em>May 2, 2025</em></p>

        <p>You can't make this stuff up. In the same week, we get two headlines that tell you everything you need to know about the current state of modern software.</p>

        <p>First, Satya Nadella proudly announces that <strong>30% of Microsoft's code is now written by AI</strong>. He spins it as "velocity" and "innovation." A few hours later? Microsoft admits that "almost all major Windows 11 core features are broken."</p>
        
        <p>Connect the dots. They fired the humans, let a hallucinating chatbot write the kernel, and then shipped the beta to us. This isn't a bug; it's the new business model. They are degrading the product to save money on developers, and we are paying the price in stability and privacy.</p>

        <p>Windows has officially become a Frankenstein's monster of AI-generated spaghetti code. If 30% of the OS is written by a machine that doesn't understand context, it's no wonder the Start Menu doesn't work. <span class="bold-text">Get off this sinking ship.</span></p>
